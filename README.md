# Number Guessing Game (Python)

## Project Description

The Number Guessing Game is an interactive Python application where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user attempts to guess it.
The program provides hints after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the actual number.

The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, after which the total number of attempts is displayed.
